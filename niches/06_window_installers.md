# Business Niche: Window Installers
## Product Name: ClearPane

## Innovat3 Solutions Strategy
This is a high-volume sales game. We feed the sales team with **High-Quality Web Leads** (not cold lists) and use **AI Automation** to nurture them 12 months down the line until they buy.

## Pain Points We Solve
1.  **Low Quality Leads**: Sales reps driving to measure windows for "tire kickers."
2.  **Follow-Up Fatigue**: Most reps stop after 1 call.
3.  **Visual Selling**: Clients can't visualize the product.

## Our Service Implementations

### 1. High-Impact Website
-   **Service**: **Energy Savings Calculator & Funnel**
-   **How it Works**: A website funnel that asks: "Calculate how much you could save on heating." It captures the lead and sets the appointment.
-   **Why It Matters**: Sells the *saving* (benefit), not just the glass.

### 2. Workflow Automation
-   **Service**: **Pre-Appointment "Show Up" Sequence**
-   **How it Works**: 24 hours before the measure: "Meet your designer, Dave. Here is what to expect."
-   **Why It Matters**: Increases appointment show-rates by **20-30%**.

### 3. Outreach Automation
-   **Service**: **Long-Term Nurture AI**
-   **How it Works**: Windows are expensive. If they don't buy today, our AI texts them in 3, 6, and 9 months with "Energy Rebate" updates.
-   **Why It Matters**: Captures the 50% of people who buy later.

### 4. Review Automation
-   **Service**: **Visual Reviews**
-   **How it Works**: Prompting customers to upload a photo of their new view/windows.
-   **Why It Matters**: Photos in reviews skyrocket conversion.

### 5. Invoicing System
-   **Service**: **Digital Deposit Collection**
-   **How it Works**: Taking the 50% deposit digitally on the spot via tablet.
-   **Why It Matters**: Locks in the deal immediately.

## ROI & Impact
-   **Sales Volume**: Long-term nurture converts **3-5%** of "lost" leads. On a $1M revenue base, that's **$30k-$50k** found money.
-   **Efficiency**: Automated reminders save the sales team from driving to "no-show" appointments.
