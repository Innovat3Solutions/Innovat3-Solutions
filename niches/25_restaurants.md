# Business Niche: Restaurants & Bars
## Product Name: TableTurn

## Innovat3 Solutions Strategy
Margins are thin and 3rd party apps like DoorDash steal your data and your profits. We build **Branded Applications** and systems that give you back control. By owning the ordering platform, you own the customer data, allowing for powerful remarketing (SMS/Email) that drives repeat business without the commissions.

## Pain Points We Solve
1.  **Commission Fees**: Delivery apps taking 30% and hiding customer data.
2.  **Missed Revenue**: "Busy lines" mean lost orders.
3.  **Labor Shortage**: Can't find staff to answer phones or take orders.

## Our Service Implementations

### 1. Custom App Development
-   **Service**: **Branded Mobile App & Online Ordering**
-   **How it Works**: A custom app tailored to your brand. Customers order pickup/delivery directly. You own the email, phone number, and order history.
-   **Why It Matters**: Eliminates 30% commission fees and builds a database you can monetize later.

### 2. Workflow Automation
-   **Service**: **AI Phone Ordering**
-   **How it Works**: An AI Voice Agent answers calls 24/7, takes orders, answers questions about the menu/hours, and inputs orders directly into the POS.
-   **Why It Matters**: Never miss a lunch rush order again just because staff is busy.

### 3. Outreach Automation
-   **Service**: **VIP Remarketing (Data Monetization)**
-   **How it Works**: Use the data captured from the App/WiFi to send targeted offers: "We missed you! Come in for a free appetizer tonight."
-   **Why It Matters**: Direct-to-consumer marketing is the most profitable channel available.

### 4. Review Automation
-   **Service**: **WiFi for Reviews**
-   **How it Works**: "Connect to Free WiFi" -> "Please leave us a review."
-   **Why It Matters**: Passive collection of thousands of reviews boosts your Google Ranking.

### 5. High-Converting Funnel
-   **Service**: **Reservation & Bottle Service Funnel** (For Clubs/Bars)
-   **How it Works**: Automated booking system requiring deposits for tables/bottles.
-   **Why It Matters**: Reduces no-shows and secures revenue upfront.

## ROI & Impact
-   **Opportunity Cost**: Missing just **5 phone orders a day** during rush (at ~$30 ticket avg) equates to **$150/day** or **$4,500/month** in lost revenue. Our system captures 100% of these.
-   **Data Value**: Owning your customer list adds tangible asset value to the business and allows you to drive revenue on demand.
