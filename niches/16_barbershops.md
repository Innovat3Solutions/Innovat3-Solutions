# Business Niche: Barbershops
## Product Name: BladePro

## Innovat3 Solutions Strategy
Barbershops rely on frequency. We implement a **Membership App** to turn "sometimes" walk-ins into guaranteed monthly recurring revenue (MRR).

## Pain Points We Solve
1.  **Wait Times**: Walk-ins sitting for 45 minutes get annoyed and leave.
2.  **Cash Only**: Old school shops limiting their clientele.
3.  **Inconsistency**: Clients drifting to other shops.

## Our Service Implementations

### 2. Workflow Automation
