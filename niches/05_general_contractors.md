# Business Niche: General Contractors
## Product Name: BuildCore

## Innovat3 Solutions Strategy
For GCs, "Organization" is the product. We provide a **Client Portal App** that puts the homeowner at ease and an **Automated Sales System** that ensures you beat the other 5 contractors to the lead.

## Pain Points We Solve
1.  **Lead "Rot"**: Buying expensive leads and calling them too late.
2.  **Communication Creep**: "He said, she said" disputes.
3.  **Payment Delays**: Relying on paper checks.

## Our Service Implementations

### 1. Custom App Development
-   **Service**: **Construction Client Portal**
-   **How it Works**: A branded app/web-portal where clients see the project timeline, view daily photo logs, and pay draw invoices.
-   **Why It Matters**: Eliminates anxiety ("Is anyone working today?") and positions the GC as a premium builder.

### 2. Workflow Automation
-   **Service**: **Speed-to-Lead Automation**
-   **How it Works**: When a new lead comes in (HomeAdvisor/Angi), the system calls the GC instantly: "New lead, press 1 to connect."

### 3. Outreach Automation

-   **Why It Matters**: Sets professional expectations instantly.

### 4. Review Automation
-   **Service**: **Milestone-Based Reviews**
-   **How it Works**: Asking for feedback after specific wins (e.g., successful inspection), not just at the end.
-   **Why It Matters**: Builds a story of consistent success.

### 5. High-Converting Funnel
-   **Service**: **Niche Project Pages**
-   **How it Works**: Dedicated landing pages for "Kitchens" vs "Bathrooms" vs "Additions."

## ROI & Impact
