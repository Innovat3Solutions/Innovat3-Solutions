# Business Niche: Pet Groomers
## Product Name: GroomMate

## Innovat3 Solutions Strategy
Groomers are busy handling dogs. They need a system that handles the humans. We provide a **"GroomCam" App** experience and automated pickup coordination.

## Pain Points We Solve
1.  **Pickup Coordination**: Playing phone tag to tell owners the dog is done.
2.  **No-Shows**: A missed dog is 2 hours of lost revenue.
3.  **Vaccine Records**: Chasing paperwork manually.

## Our Service Implementations

### 1. Custom App Development

-   **Why It Matters**: Reduces anxiety and phone calls ("is he ready yet?").

### 2. Workflow Automation
-   **Service**: **"Ready for Pickup" SMS**
